# WebSocket Service Improvements Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive improvements to the Flash plugin's WebSocket service to address connection stability issues, particularly the "remote party closed connection without completing handshake" errors and reconnection storms.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Connection State Management
- Added `WebSocketConnectionState` enum with states: Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Reconnecting, Disconnecting, Failed
- Implemented thread-safe state transitions with `_connectionLock` semaphore
- Added `ConnectionStateChanged` event for monitoring state changes
- Prevents duplicate connection attempts

### 2. Exponential Backoff with Jitter
- Created `WebSocketRetryPolicy` class with configurable parameters:
  - Initial delay: 1 second
  - Maximum delay: 2 minutes
  - Backoff multiplier: 2.0
  - Maximum jitter: 3 seconds
  - Maximum retry attempts: 10
- Prevents reconnection storms by gradually increasing delay between attempts
- Added randomization (jitter) to prevent thundering herd problem

### 3. Health Monitoring and Metrics
- Created `WebSocketHealthMetrics` class tracking:
  - Messages sent/received
  - Reconnection attempts
  - Error counts
  - Connection duration
  - Last message timestamps
- Provides visibility into connection health and performance

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific handling for different WebSocket exceptions
- Graceful handling of abrupt disconnections
- Proper cleanup on all error paths
- Detailed logging with context for troubleshooting

### 5. Keep-Alive Mechanism
- Implemented active ping/pong timer (30-second intervals)
- Tracks last pong received to detect stale connections
- Automatic connection health verification

### 6. Improved Resource Management
- Proper disposal of all resources (timers, WebSocket, cancellation tokens)
- Thread-safe cleanup procedures
- Prevents resource leaks

## Technical Details

### New Classes Created
1. `WebSocketConnectionState.cs` - Connection state enum and event args
2. `WebSocketRetryPolicy.cs` - Retry policy configuration and delay calculation
3. `WebSocketHealthMetrics.cs` - Connection health tracking

### Updated Interface
- Added `ConnectionState` property
- Added `HealthMetrics` property
- Added `ConnectionStateChanged` event

### Key Methods Enhanced
- `ConnectAsync()` - Now uses connection lock and state management
- `ReceiveLoop()` - Better error handling, no immediate reconnect
- `HandleReconnectAsync()` - New method implementing exponential backoff
- `DisconnectAsync()` - Graceful shutdown with proper state transitions
- `CleanupConnection()` - Comprehensive resource cleanup

## Benefits
1. **Prevents Connection Storms** - Exponential backoff prevents rapid reconnection attempts
2. **Better Observability** - Health metrics and state tracking provide visibility
3. **Improved Stability** - Proper error handling and state management
4. **Resource Efficiency** - No duplicate connections or leaked resources
5. **Graceful Degradation** - Falls back to polling when WebSocket unavailable

## Configuration
The retry policy can be customized by modifying the `WebSocketRetryPolicy` initialization in the constructor:
```csharp
_retryPolicy = new WebSocketRetryPolicy
{
    InitialDelay = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    MaxDelay = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2),
    BackoffMultiplier = 2.0,
    MaxJitter = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3),
    MaxRetryAttempts = 10
};
```

## Next Steps
- Integration testing with various failure scenarios
- Performance testing under load
- Consider making retry policy configurable via settings
- Add metrics reporting to monitoring systems
