# Release Notes - v1.4.1

## Release Date: June 13, 2025

## Overview
This release focuses on production readiness with critical bug fixes, complete Lightning interface implementation, and enhanced error handling.

## New Features

### ‚úÖ Complete Lightning Interface Implementation
- **PayInvoiceParams Support**: Implemented the missing `PayInvoiceAsync(PayInvoiceParams)` overload for full Lightning API compatibility
- **Payment History**: Implemented `ListPaymentsAsync` to display outgoing Lightning payments with proper filtering and pagination

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Error Handling
- **Centralized Error Handler**: New `FlashErrorHandler` service for consistent error handling across the plugin
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for transient failures with exponential backoff
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for common issues

### üîå Connection Validation
- **Connection String Validator**: Validates Flash connection strings before use
- **Connection Testing**: Test Flash API connectivity with detailed diagnostics
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensures all required parameters are present and valid

## Bug Fixes

### üéØ Boltcard Payment Detection (Critical)
- **Issue**: Boltcard payments were successful but not detected by BTCPay Server
- **Root Cause**: Payment hash extraction was using bech32 format instead of hex
- **Fix**: Proper BOLT11 parsing using NBitcoin library to extract hex-encoded payment hash
- **Impact**: Boltcard tap-to-pay now works reliably

### üí∞ Pull Payment Amount Handling (Critical)
- **Issue**: Pull payment amounts in satoshis were interpreted as USD dollars
- **Root Cause**: Missing satoshi-to-USD conversion for pull payment payouts
- **Fix**: Added proper amount conversion based on current exchange rates
- **Impact**: Pull payments now process correct amounts with minimum validation

### ‚ö° Payment Synchronization
- **Issue**: Race condition between payment completion and status queries
- **Fix**: Added 5-minute payment cache for immediate detection
- **Impact**: Payments are instantly detected even before API indexing
