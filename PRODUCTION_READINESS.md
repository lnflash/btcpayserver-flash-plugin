## Features Not Yet Implemented

### ðŸ”´ Critical TODOs
1. **PayInvoiceParams Overload** (`FlashPaymentService.cs:49`)
   - Required for advanced payment parameters

2. **ListPaymentsAsync** (`FlashPaymentService.cs:180`)
   - Needed for payment history display

3. **LNURL Support** (`FlashPaymentService.cs:366, 389`)
   - LNURL resolution
   - LNURL payout processing

### ðŸŸ¡ Important TODOs
1. **Boltcard Tracking** (`FlashBoltcardService.cs:67`)
   - Enhanced Boltcard transaction tracking

2. **Transaction History Checking** (`FlashBoltcardService.cs:168`)
   - Improved transaction correlation

3. **No-Amount Invoice Support** (`FlashPaymentService.cs:352`)
   - Setting amounts on zero-amount invoices

## Production Readiness Checklist

### High Priority
- [ ] Implement critical payment methods (PayInvoiceParams, ListPayments)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for all GraphQL operations
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed operations
- [ ] Add request/response logging (sanitized)
- [ ] Security review of API token handling
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Connection string validation

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Complete LNURL support
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical paths
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Add performance metrics
- [ ] Implement health check endpoint

### Low Priority
- [ ] Optimize GraphQL queries
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Implement batch operations

## Known Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection**
   - May fail with 503 error (non-critical, falls back to polling)

2. **Flash API Quirks**
   - Transaction indexing delay (mitigated with cache)
   - Requires USD wallet for Lightning operations

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Implement Critical Methods** (1-2 days)
   - Focus on PayInvoiceParams and ListPaymentsAsync
   - These are core Lightning functionality

2. **Error Handling Enhancement** (1 day)
   - Add try-catch blocks with specific error types
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Better error messages for users

3. **Security Hardening** (1 day)
   - Review token storage and handling
   - Add input validation
   - Implement rate limiting

4. **Testing** (2-3 days)
   - Create integration tests
   - Manual testing of all features
   - Load testing for production scenarios

5. **Documentation** (1 day)
   - Installation guide
   - Configuration instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Estimated Time to Production: 1-2 weeks

With focused effort on the critical TODOs and proper testing, the plugin can be production-ready within 1-2 weeks.
